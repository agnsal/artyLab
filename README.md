# artyLab
In this project I performed some VHDL/Assembly exercises.


There are different sections, each one corresponding to a folder (named as the relative section).
Every section contains a different exercise type:
- Section 1: Simulation and Synthesis of simple combinatorial circuits
- Section 2: Sequential circuits, I/O and constraints
- Section 3: PicoBlaze
- Section 4: Section 4: Serial Communication


You can see needed tools, dependencies and the steps I followed to create it on ArtyLab.pdf. 
If you like, you can change program files to change System behaviour.
